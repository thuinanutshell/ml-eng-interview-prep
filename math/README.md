# Easy

- [ ] Whatâ€™s the geometric interpretation of the dot product of two vectors?
- [ ] Given a vector $u$, find vector $v$ of unit length such that the dot product of $u$ and $v$ is maximum.
- [ ] Given two vectors $a = [3, 2, 1]$ and $b = [-1, 0, 1]$. Calculate the outer product $a^T b$?
- [ ] What does it mean for two vectors to be linearly independent?
- [ ] What's a norm? What is $L_0,L_1,L_2,L_{\text{norm}}$

# Medium

- [ ] Give an example of how the outer product can be useful in ML
- [ ] Given two sets of vectors $A = a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots, a_n$ and $B=b_1,b_2,b_3,\dots, b_m$. How do you check that they share the same basis?
- [ ] Given $n$ vectors, each of $d$ dimensions. What is the dimension of their span?
- [ ] How do norm and metric differ? Given a norm, make a metric. Given a metric, can we make a norm?
